# yolov3_OpenCV


This tutorial is about creating an API using FLASK for an image recognition task by YOLOv3 algorithm. 

It is important to know the codes of this Doc were writen by OpenCV library. After running this code you will be amazed how powerful openCv is.
The same algorithm (yolov3) was writen by tensorflow too. You can access it in [this link](https://github.com/sheydabahrami/YOLOv3_TF2)

NOTE: API_yolov3.py is the API for the model.

Here's the output example:
